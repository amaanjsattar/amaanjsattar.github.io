## About Me {#about-me}

I am an incoming MS/PhD student in Biostatistics at the [UCLA Fielding School of Public Health](https://www.ph.ucla.edu/). My current research interests lie in chronic disease epidemiology, precision health/biomarker discovery, and clinical trial design.

I recently graduated from UC Berkeley (go bears!) with a BA in Public Health and a minor in Data Science. As an undergraduate, I led research at the [UC Berkeley Disability Lab](https://disabilitylab.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) under the supervision of [Professor Karen Nakamura](http://www.disability.jp/nakamura/).

I conducted research under [Professor Nikola Banovic](https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/nikola-banovic/) at the University of Michigan within the 2022 [Big Data Summer Institute](https://sph.umich.edu/bdsi/index.html).

Recently, I conducted survival analysis and prognostic biomarker research under [Professor Paul Boutros](https://bioscience.ucla.edu/people/paul-c-boutros/) at UCLA within the [Bruins-in-Genomics Summer (BIG Summer)](https://qcb.ucla.edu/big-summer/) research experience.
